# CrispASR and Auto language Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** Use `executing-plans` inline, as approved by the founder.
> Implement each task with focused red/green checks and a conventional commit.

**Goal:** Ship the three approved quantized local models, background recognition,
and an end-to-end Auto spoken-language choice.

**Architecture:** A persistent C++ CrispASR sidecar owns native inference. Rust
owns model management, process lifecycle and generation-keyed stream results;
React and native menus reuse the existing model and language surfaces.

**Tech Stack:** Tauri 2, Rust 1.91.1, React 19/TypeScript, C++20/CMake,
CrispASR v0.8.41 at `340d7085eaa53c40a46dcb73a6d3d0448a480006`.

## Task 1 — Auto language as a spoken-language capability

Files: `src-tauri/src/whisper/languages.rs`,
`src-tauri/src/commands/settings.rs`, `src-tauri/src/menu/languages.rs`,
`src-tauri/src/whisper/transcriber.rs`,
`sidecar/whisper-vulkan/src/main.rs`, `src-tauri/src/transcription.rs`,
`src-tauri/src/writing/pipeline.rs`, `src/components/LanguageSelection.tsx`,
and colocated tests. Keep translation-target language lists separate.

- [x] Add tests for Auto selection, supported-language filtering, English-only
  models and explicit-language-only Cohere. In native tests assert:
  ```rust
  assert_eq!(normalize_speech_language_for_model("whisper", "base", "auto"), "auto");
  assert_eq!(normalize_speech_language_for_model("whisper", "base.en", "auto"), "en");
  assert_eq!(TranscriptionTask::Transcribe.fallback_transcript_language(Some("auto")), None);
  ```
- [x] Run focused tests and confirm the absent Auto behavior is the failure.
- [x] Preserve `auto` in spoken settings, normalize it to an unconstrained
  engine request, and pass `Some("")` to Whisper's `FullParams::set_language`.
  Use `WhisperState::full_lang_id_from_state()` (verify the pinned binding's
  spelling before use) for detected-language metadata, without another model
  pass. Missing settings keep the existing English default.
- [x] Add Auto to the selector and native menu capability paths; never add it
  to the shared list used for explicit output-language selection. Keep unknown
  transcript output language as `same_as_transcript` in the writing pipeline.
- [x] Run `pnpm exec vitest run src/components/LanguageSelection.test.tsx`,
  `pnpm typecheck`, and focused Windows language tests with `run-tests.ps1`.
- [x] Commit Auto support (`ee11107c`); startup/model-switch follow-ups in `3ef928c5`.

## Task 2 — Reproducible native sidecar and protocol

Create `sidecar/crispasr/targets.cmake`, `sidecar/crispasr/src/main.cpp`,
`sidecar/crispasr/src/session.{h,cpp}`, `sidecar/crispasr/tests/`,
`scripts/build-crispasr-sidecar.mjs`, and `sidecar/crispasr/README.md`.

- [x] Add a protocol harness that sends `status`, an invalid model load, a
  stale stream command, and `shutdown`; assert typed responses and clean exit.
  The harness must reject missing executable/invalid JSON as a failed check,
  not as a skipped success.
- [x] Build from the pinned upstream source and its pinned ggml dependency.
  Keep only the required adapters in the executable where upstream's link
  structure permits. Build CPU first; add Metal/Vulkan configurations.
- [x] Implement an owning session class around `CrispasrBackend`:
  ```cpp
  std::unique_ptr<CrispasrBackend> backend;
  std::unique_ptr<CrispasrRealtimeSession> stream;
  ```
  Serialize backend access, reuse matching loaded models, explicitly warm,
  and destroy stream state before unloading the backend.
- [x] Implement versioned JSON commands and structured errors. Require request
  and session identities; validate PCM size/rate and model paths. Keep stdout
  protocol-only and suppress native payload-bearing diagnostics.
- [x] Run CTest and the protocol harness against the built CPU executable.
- [x] Commit native sidecar (`4f570fc1`) and checked failure propagation (`206d95a0`).

## Task 3 — Catalog, downloads and Rust process client

Create `src-tauri/src/crispasr/{mod,models,messages,manager,sidecar}.rs`.
Modify `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, `src-tauri/src/commands/model.rs`,
`src-tauri/src/commands/settings.rs`, `src/types.ts`, and model lifecycle tests.

- [x] Test the three catalog identities, distinct sizes/checksums, language
  sets, and downloaded-state handling for missing/partial files.
- [x] Pin the HF model revisions and SHA-256s recorded by the upstream tree
  APIs. Use a streaming download and digest, with rename only after validation.
- [x] Test protocol IDs, cancellation, timeout and process termination using a
  committed deterministic fixture process. Implement the client with
  `tokio::process`, bounded requests, `kill_on_drop` and lazy restart.
- [x] Register `CrispasrManager` as managed app state, route local lifecycle
  commands to it, and reuse existing progress/error events and UI model rows.
- [x] Route preload on selection through the manager and unload on shutdown
  without disturbing the existing Whisper/remote/media/analytics teardown order.
- [x] Run focused native lifecycle tests, model-management Vitest and typecheck.
- [x] Commit catalog in the buildable integration slice (`3ef928c5`).

## Task 4 — Shared batch execution and capability integration

Modify `src-tauri/src/provider_capabilities.rs`,
`src-tauri/src/transcription/{engines,executor,stream}.rs`,
`src-tauri/src/commands/audio.rs`, `src-tauri/src/cli.rs`,
`src-tauri/src/menu/`, `src-tauri/src/pill/`, and readiness/model consumers.

- [x] Add dispatch and capability truth-table cases for `crispasr`.
- [x] Reject unsupported translate tasks and retain model-specific language
  sets. Convert native segments/timestamps to `TranscriptionResult` and leave
  missing language/timestamps unknown rather than fabricating values.
- [x] Route desktop, uploads and CLI through the same manager. Prepare mono
  16 kHz input without copying Whisper-only gain/trim/decode parameters.
- [x] Test catalog rejection, Auto/model selection, missing runtime UI, capability
  and readiness contracts. Packaged entry-point behavior remains 082-S2/S5.
- [x] Run focused executor/model tests and frontend model/readiness tests.
- [x] Commit shared recognition routing (`3ef928c5`).

## Task 5 — Background streams and final authority

Create `src-tauri/src/crispasr/{stream,final_result}.rs`; extend native session
tests and sidecar handling. Keep wiring in `commands/audio.rs` small by
placing the new sink/factory and result lifecycle in the engine module.

- [x] Test final-result admission by generation, model, language, complete
  sample coverage and no dropped frames; test cancellation and stale results.
- [x] Feed the existing stream tap through the streaming resampler, including
  `finish()` at stop. Bound ingress to 5 s and retained stream audio to 120 s.
- [x] Implement Parakeet context-preserving preview scheduling with one active
  decode and a replaceable tentative tail (no premature commits). Finalize once
  over complete audio and deliver that result through the handoff.
- [x] Use upstream `create_realtime_session` / `append(..., flush, callback)`
  for R2T2. Keep upstream prefix rollback and language semantics. A valid final
  bypasses batch; invalid/incomplete sessions use complete-file fallback.
- [x] Wire background processing independently of preview visibility. Keep
  final inference outside recorder join deadlines and cancel stale work.
- [x] Run ordered-audio, overflow, cancellation, final-authority and PCM boundary
  tests, followed by a real-speech sidecar stream smoke.
- [x] Commit background capture/final reuse with shared routing (`3ef928c5`).

## Task 6 — Packaging and final evidence

Files: `src-tauri/tauri.{macos,windows}.conf.json`, relevant build/CI workflow
steps, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `plans/SMOKE.md`, the real-speech harness under
`scripts/`, and this plan's completion notes.

- [x] Stage target-qualified sidecars and required runtime licenses through
  the Node build helper; verify CPU fallback does not require a Vulkan driver.
- [x] Run `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, focused/full relevant Vitest, Windows
  backend tests, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
  `cargo fmt --check`, and native CTest without forced clean rebuilds.
- [x] Run the committed harness on redistributable real speech for every model
  available locally. Record load, first partial, stop-to-final, WER/text and
  stream-vs-batch differences. Record unavailable hardware as `NEEDS-SMOKE`.
- [x] Inspect final diff, privacy of diagnostics, source pins, and build
  outputs; package configuration and verification evidence accompany this update.

## Execution notes

- 2026-10-05: implementation and Windows verification complete; packaged desktop,
  native macOS builds/runtime and multilingual/long-speech quality remain
  `NEEDS-SMOKE` in `plans/SMOKE.md` (082-S1–S5). Evidence and exact limitations:
  `docs/reports/2026-10-05-crispasr.md`.
- Final gates: 1,788 Windows library tests, 1,259 frontend tests, typecheck,
  oxlint, frontend production build, workspace/all-target clippy, Rust format,
  actionlint, CPU/Vulkan CTest and native protocol checks. All three models also
  pass the Rust-to-native real-speech batch/recording test. Full suites run
  sequentially with four workers to avoid observed timer contention.
- Tasks 3–5 landed together in `3ef928c5`: manager registration, engine enum
  routing and stream ownership reference each other, so the slice remains
  buildable. Native runtime, native failure handling and packaging are separate
  commits. No push/release was performed.
- Native build adaptation: upstream assumes it owns `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`, so
  `targets.cmake` is injected into its pinned root project. The local adapter
  uses C++20 designated initialization while upstream libraries retain their
  own build settings. No upstream source edits are required.
- Review regressions were reproduced before fixes: aborted requests leaving a
  live child, missed cleanup during preload, Auto lost on React model selection,
  and encoder/prefill/decoder errors reported as successful native finals. All
  now pass; follow-up review found no remaining blockers in those fixes.

- Auto language slice: red/green verified (three selector failures and three
  native policy/metadata failures before implementation; prompt test exposed
  and then verified removal of the implicit English instruction). Now 45
  focused frontend tests, 51 native language tests, TypeScript and oxlint pass.
  Vulkan-sidecar Rust checking passes. Workspace clippy exceeded the bounded
  local timeout; no successful clippy result is claimed for that command.
  Native language tests use application-only test profile overrides
  `profile.test.package.voicetypr.debug=0` and `opt-level=0` to avoid repeated
  oversized debug links, then the normal Windows manifest embedding step.

- Founder requested and approved a Windows shipped-bindings prerequisite:
  local `whisper-rs-sys` patch, original checksum-pinned 1.76 MB source archive,
  x64/ARM64 generated snapshots, and native C/Rust ABI checks. The unpatched
  option reproduced three Linux CRT size-assertion failures on Windows. The
  x64 ABI test now passes with an invalid `LIBCLANG_PATH`. The application
  compiled with shipped bindings and its 46 language tests passed after the
  standard Common-Controls manifest was embedded. Vulkan-sidecar Rust checking
  also passed (`DOCS_RS=1`, so this is not a native Vulkan link/smoke check).
- The founder approved moving this session's build cache to
  `D:\voicetypr-build\crispasr-auto` after C: ran out of disk during app linking.
  A worktree-local `src-tauri/target` junction preserves cached native paths.

- 2026-10-04: 43 baseline frontend tests pass across model preview controls,
  island quick settings and settings persistence. Existing Vite config warning
  and the expected rejected-settings test diagnostic are present at baseline.
- Windows environment has Node 24.12.0, pnpm 11.8.0, Rust 1.91.1, CMake 4.4.3
  and Visual Studio 18 Build Tools. Native tools still need environment setup.
